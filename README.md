## About

Project called "IPC Publish-Subscribe" allows logged-in users of the system to communicate between each other by transmitting their broadcast messages based on their previously subscribed types. Responsible for proper operation of the system is the server through which all activities pass, and therefore the communication between clients is indirect, as the server mentioned is always involved in it.

## Client functionality

1. Login to the system
2. Display the menu
3. Display available messages types to subscribe
4. Registration to the broadcast system
5. Registration of message type
6. Broadcast new message
7. Synchronous receive of the message
8. Asynchronous receive of the message
9. Block a user
10. Logout from the system

## The server

Additionally created server lists all the infomation about the actions it takes and their effects, which was helpful and convenient while writing and testing the program. A time limitation of its operation has been also implemented, which means that the server will operate for a maximum number of seconds (after the last client logs out of the system) as the value of SERVER_STANDBY_TIME, which can be freely configured and is set to 10 seconds by default.

## Compilation

Unix:

<code>gcc -Wall server.c -o server</code>\
<code>gcc -Wall client.c -o client</code>

## Running

To run the whole program, we should start with the server:

<code>./server</code>

Then, in each new console window, we have the option to run the client program:

<code>./client</code>
